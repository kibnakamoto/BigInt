The library is optmized for C++23 and the benchmark tests prove that certain things like addition work in nanoseconds which is extremely fast.

Around 11 constructors and functions for input. Including Consteval input. Use the test file for reference when wondering how to use.

Garunteed to work for the following supported bitsizes: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384.
